## **📌 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning**  

### 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project is a simple **Sentiment Analysis model** that classifies text as **positive, negative, or neutral** using **Naïve Bayes**.  
It is built using **Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and TfidfVectorizer** to preprocess text and train a machine learning model.

## **🛠 Installation & Setup**  
To run this project on your local machine:  

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sentiment-Analysis-Project.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Project
```

2️⃣ **Install required dependencies**  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib
```

3️⃣ **Download stopwords (if using NLTK)**  
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

4️⃣ **Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab**

## **📊 Features**  
✅ Preprocesses text (removes stopwords, punctuation, and converts to lowercase)  
✅ Converts text into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
✅ Uses **Naïve Bayes** for classification  
✅ Provides accuracy and classification reports  
✅ Allows users to test custom text inputs  

---

## **📊 Results & Model Performance**  
The model achieves **X% accuracy** (replace with actual accuracy).  
Below is an example classification:  

| Text | Predicted Sentiment |  
|------|--------------------|  
| "I love this product!" | Positive |  
| "This is terrible." | Negative |  
| "It’s okay, nothing special." | Neutral |  

---

## **📝 How to Use the Model**  
You can test the model on your own text by running:  
```python
predict_sentiment("I really love this phone!")
```
Expected Output:  
```
'positive'
```

## **📌 Future Improvements**  
🔹 Train on a larger dataset (e.g., IMDB, Twitter data)  
🔹 Try advanced ML models like **Logistic Regression, LSTMs, or Transformers**  
🔹 Deploy the model using **Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit**
